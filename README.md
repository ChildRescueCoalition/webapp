# @childrescuecoalition/webapp

A microservice framework for MVC web applications and RESTful APIs.

# Installing and Using

## Self Setup

NPM wants to always pull from it's home repository. You have to indicate that you are fetching from a different repository based on scope, by logging in:

```
$ npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/ --scope=@childrescuecoalition
$ npm install @childrescuecoalition/webapp
```

**Note 1:** You will only need to authenticate once, unless you use the _--always-auth_ option when logging in.

**Note 2:** Your username and e-mail are the ones from GitHub, however don't use your password, instead create an [access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

## From Template

An easy alternative is to [create a new repository](/new) and then choose [@childrescuecoalition/microserver](/ChildRescueCoalition/microserver) as your _Repository Template_. At that point you have a basic webapp ready to run.
