A microservice framework for MVC web applications and RESTful APIs.

# Installing and Using

NPM wants to always pull from it's home repository. You have to indicate that you are fetching from a different repository based on scope, by logging in:

```
$ npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/ --scope=@childrescuecoalition
$ npm install @childrescuecoalition/webapp
```

**Note 1:** You will only need to authenticate once, unless you use the _--always-auth_ option when logging in.

**Note 2:** Your username and e-mail are the ones from GitHub, however don't use your password, instead create an [access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
